# ProblemSolving
My implementation &amp; usage of data structures to solve problems

Contents :
1. Binary Trees
   1.1 Is it a complete Binary Tree
   1.2 Diameter of a Binary Tree
   1.3 Find the node in a Binary Tree
   1.4 Flatten the Binary Tree
   1.5 Height of the Binary Tree (Iterative solution)
   1.6 InOrder of Binary Tree (Iterative solution)
   1.7 Level order of Binary Tree
   1.8 Level Order of Binary Tree & print line by line
   1.9 Merging 2 Binary Trees
   1.10 Preorder of a Binary Tree (Iterative solution)
   1.11 If the Binary Trees is symmetric 
   
  
2. Heap
   2.1 Kth smallest element 
   2.2 Implementation of max heap
   2.3 To merge k sorted lists
   2.4 Implementation of min heap
   2.5 To sort characters by frequency of occurence
   2.6 To retrieve the top k elements
   
3. Single Linked List
   3.1 Delete a node in linked list
   3.2 Basic operations of linked list (add at tail, add at head, print)
   3.3 Merge two sorted linked lists 
   3.4 If palindrome
   3.5 Reverse a linked list
